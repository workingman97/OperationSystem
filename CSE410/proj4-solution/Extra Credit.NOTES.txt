1. As stated on the assignment handout, your solution must compile, link, and
execute correctly using "g++" on the CSE Linux systems (such as "cse410").

2. As stated on the assignment handout, you are required to create a makefile which controls the translation of your program, and the name of your executable file must be "extracredit04".

3. You may use masking and shifting to decompose the 16-bit logical addresses.  The example program in the following file demonstrates three methods for extracting bit fields:
