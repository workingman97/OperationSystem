
Notes on Computer Project #4
----------------------------

Comments about the assignment and responses to frequently asked questions will
be added to this file as necessary.

1. As stated on the assignment handout, your solution must compile, link, and execute correctly using "g++" on the CSE Linux systems (such as "cse410").

2. As stated on the assignment handout, you are required to create a makefile which controls the translation of your program, and the name of your executable file must be "proj04".

3. The following file contains a sample input:

   /user/cse410/Projects/project04.data

Since it only contains 4 memory references, it clearly is not adequate to test your program -- it is only useful as an example of the file format.

4. You may use masking and shifting to decompose the 16-bit logical addresses.
The example program in the following file demonstrates three methods for extracting bit fields:

   /user/cse410/Projects/project04.unpack.c

5. Possible extra credit could involve extending the program which you develop for Project #4.  Good coding practices and commenting your source code is, as always, a requirement.
